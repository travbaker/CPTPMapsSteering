# CPTPMapsSteering

This is a small collection of Python scripts to accompany the manuscript [Necessary conditions for steerability of two qubits, from consideration of local operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04693). 
All results from the numerical simulations presented in the above paper can be reproduced using these codes. 

To run these scripts you will need the latest version of Python 3, with [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) and [QuTiP](http://qutip.org/) installed.

Purpose of the files:
- mapped_integration_werner.py: simulations for Fig. (2) in paper above.
- mapped_integration_2DT.py: simulations for Fig. 3(a) in paper above.
- mapped_integration_3DT.py: simulations for Fig. 3(b) in paper above.
